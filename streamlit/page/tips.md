# Tips and Tricks

---

**:rainbow[First of all]** thank you for using the AI Tutor :smile:

I have put an incredible amount of effort into this project
with the hope of genuinely making this a good tool to use as opposed to
more AI garbage.

I wanted to share some tips and tricks for anyone who chooses to read through this page.

### Courses

When you open the tutor you will first notice the *circularish* buttons.

These are your courses or at least, the courses that the Tutor has found.

If you :primary[select or deselect] courses, the tutor will **only** chat with you
about those courses. This way if you really want to focus on a particular class or subject,
you can simply select only those courses.

### Settings

**Additionally**, we have a couple pages, one is settings. You can choose which courses
(if any) you want to show in the chat page.

### Assignments and Updates

Currently, the tutor has access to all upcoming assignments :primary[within one week], and any recent *activities*.

*Activities* are essentially updates like:

* Recent graded items :rainbow[with submission comments]
* Announcements
* Messages
* Discussions

... Pretty much anything that you would find from canvas anyway.

The tutor now :green[only returns assignments that have not been graded.]

### Webpages

One of my favorite features is the ability to *literally* just copy and paste a url for the tutor and let it read webpages for you.
Lets say you want a summary, or help understanding something, just copy and paste the url of that site and send it to the tutor.

Anyway, I will update this page as I add features and do my best to make this a better experience.

:rainbow[Please] don't be afraid to send me feature requests or any bugs you find :grin:
