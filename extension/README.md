# Browser Extension

This is the browser extension for the AI Tutor project

## Development

1. `npm init -y`
2. `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli style-loader css-loader copy-webpack-plugin dotenv`
3. `npx webpack --mode development`

Note:

I think I can remove scripting and storage from permissions
