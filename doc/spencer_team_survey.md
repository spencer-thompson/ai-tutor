# Open-ended Questions

### What was your role in the project, and what were your main contributions? 

I was the Technical Team Lead for the AI Tutor project. I was the lead developer, as well as the technical lead.
So I made the final decisions regarding API design, technical architecture, and everything in between.
I also contributed significantly just to facilitating communication between developers and management.

### What technical challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them? 

There have been many technical challenges encountered in this project, for a more comprehensive look I have written a technical report.
The most notable technical challenges though were Authentication / API Access and Tutor behavior.
Regarding Authentication and API access, we created a browser extension to enable communication between the Canvas API,
and used their authentication to simplify and secure our own in a very unique and creative way.
Regarding tutor behavior, we used a clever mix of dynamic system messages and clever tool calls to provide a very good tutoring experience for students.

### How did you approach designing the AI Tutor within the constraints? 

Many features had to be postponed or deemed simply out of scope.
This was probably the most difficult aspect of creating and maintaining the AI Tutor.
Having a successful project with many users who are excited to use our software, made it difficult to focus on what features were important.

### What did you learn from working on this interdisciplinary team? 

I learned that communication is very nuanced and important to a successful team.
Communicating the needs and wants of engineers as well as adhering to a predefined scope are both difficult and very vital to project success.

### In what ways has this experience influenced your future goals? 

This project has been the project that taught me more about real software development and programming than any other project in university.
API design and creating systems that can be easily maintained and updated **while** in production is a truly unique challenge.
