# Feedback Analysis and Action Plan

## Analysis of Feedback

The user feedback is generally positive, with users appreciating the AI Tutor's integration with Canvas for accessing assignments and grades. The ability to answer specific questions and provide summaries is also highly valued. However, several key areas for improvement have been identified:

**Key Issues & Bugs:**
*   **Accuracy:** There are instances of the AI providing incorrect information, particularly regarding class schedules and assignments with distant due dates.
*   **Stability:** Several users reported crashes and error messages, especially when asking certain types of questions.
*   **Complex Queries:** The AI struggles with complex or multi-part questions and does not handle "cafeteria-style" grading structures well.
*   **Scope:** The AI's knowledge is limited to the information it can access, leading to incorrect assumptions (e.g., all assignments are required).

**Feature Requests & Suggestions:**
*   **Syllabus Integration:** Direct access to the course syllabus would significantly improve accuracy, especially for grading policies and assignment requirements.
*   **Expanded Scope:** Users want the AI to provide information on school events, announcements, and course locations (including a map).
*   **Improved Task Management:** Suggestions include adding timeframes to assignments and providing reminders for due dates.
*   **Onboarding:** Some users were confused about how to use the tool or that it required a browser extension.

## Plan to Address Feedback

Based on the analysis, the following actions are proposed:

1.  **Improve Accuracy and Stability:**
    *   **Bug Fixing:** Prioritize fixing the identified bugs, including the causes of crashes and incorrect information.
    *   **Enhanced Canvas Integration:** Improve the data retrieval from Canvas to get more accurate and complete information, including assignments with distant due dates.
    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the AI's ability to understand the context of questions, especially for complex and multi-part queries.

2.  **Implement High-Impact Features:**
    *   **Syllabus Integration:** Develop a feature to allow the AI to access and understand the course syllabus. This will be the highest priority new feature.
    *   **Improved Onboarding:** Create a better onboarding experience for new users, explaining how to use the tool and its limitations.
    *   **Task Management Features:** Investigate the feasibility of adding timeframes to assignments and a reminder system.

3.  **Expand the AI's Knowledge Base:**
    *   **School-wide Information:** Explore the possibility of integrating with other school systems to provide information on events and announcements.
    *   **Location Services:** Investigate adding a map feature for course locations.

4.  **Continuous Improvement:**
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a more direct way for users to provide feedback within the application.
    *   **Monitoring:** Continue to monitor user feedback and system performance to identify and address issues proactively.

# User Feedback

> The AI tutor was very helpful. I was surprised at how well it was able to access the information in Canvas. I was able to ask it some very specific questions about grades, and it had the answers. I also had a question about accessing my textbooks through Wolverine Access and it was able to answer than and help me find what I was looking for. I likely wouldn't have been able to find it on my own very easily, and I found it useful to have the AI Tutor to help me.

---

> After I downloaded the Ai, the first question I asked was, "What are my missing assignments?"  It gave me a list of upcoming assignments due this week.  Basically I asked it questions about assignments, due dates and which are most urgent.  The feedback was on point.  I will continue to use the Ai to check on my assignments and grades as well.  I feel it lacks in the accuracy of providing overall school events, announcements and personalization of course times and location; I feel a map for location to each course would really help, especially in the first couple weeks of class.

---

> The AI tutor was interesting. I didn't appreciate that I had to download an extension in order to use it, but I digress. I enjoyed the AI tutor. I asked it to help me understand technology that goes with human genome editing. We started off with what it is, how the editing works, key players, editing techniques, an overview, ethics, and then it asked me to ask more questions so we could refine my understanding and move deeper into our understanding of this topic. I will probably use this tutor for math, because that is what I struggle with the most.

---

> I asked it to create a homework schedule where I take 3 hours per class per week. Which is honestly on par with what I do typically. The feature I appreciate most is it seems to be oriented to serving UVU students which is nice, but will become a pitfall if a BYU student tried to use this program. I won't mention improvements just yet since I expect to experience some things as I use this system I rather not give feedback just yet. I'm not sure how I will use this program.

---

> After downloading the AI tutor I am unsure of where to implement this, I noticed that the tutor is still in development. Hopefully I will be able to use this in canvas to assess what my standings are in my courses.

---

> I asked the AI tutor about the Delphinium program since I hadn't used it before. I first asked if points show up automatically after completing assignments or if you have to wait for grading, and it answered my question. However, I found the AI less helpful in a cafeteria-style format. When I asked if TechTip assignments were required, it said all assignments were required, which could be improved with syllabus access. I plan to keep using the AI tutor for questions, as it often provides answers before I need to ask my teacher.

---

> I found the AI tutor helpful in explaining assignments, sometimes it helps just to see it reworded. This semester I have two cafeteria style classes, including this one. I've been told multiple times that canvas doesn't understand cafeteria style, so I was curious if the AI understood it. When I asked it to explain the grading system for those classes, it told me that there were categories weighted differently that would contribute to a final grade. I tried being more specific, and asked it to explain the system based off the syllabus, but it gave me the same answer. I do think I will use it to explain confusing assignments, but definitely double check everything it says.

---

> AI Tutor is a lot cooler than I had expected going into this and am glad I did.  The connectivity it has with all my school info is extremally helpful for wanting to know when my next test might be.  I put it through some stress tests to see if it would falter, but it gave me what I was looking for every time.  I plan to actually use this in the future for all school related needs.

---

> My experience with the AI tutor was mixed. With my first question I asked if I had
any upcoming assignments in my aviation class. I did not mention the title of this class
as this class was called AVSC 1010 but it understood that this class was the class I was
talking about. However it could not pull up an assignment that was due later this month
in that class.
My second question was probably the most successful question. I asked what
assignments were due this week and it pulled up all the assignments that were due this
week from all five of my courses. They were all correct and this made me very happy.
It does not take multiple questions at once, it struggled with midterms but defined
other things extremely well. In the future, I will probably just ask it simple questions
regarding the syllabus or due dates which it accomplishes very well. Overall the AI tutor
has potential.

---

> I asked the Ai assistant to tell me the things I need to get done for the week. I asked the Ai than to assist me on prioritizing my time for the assignments this week. I found out that it gives you links quickly to the assignments due. I would recommend adding timeframes for assigments to better organize my time and attention. I plan to use it to help me organize and prioritize my assignments in the week and month throughout the semester.

---

> I got a message that said the AI Tutor is currently in development, I do not know if that is why I could not really use it.

---

> I thought that the AI tutor was really cool, I first asked it when my next assignment was due and it gave me a list in each course and even the next due date! I think that it is super helpful that it connects to my canvas courses. I think that the AI tutor will be really helpful in understanding complicated subjects without needing to head to google. 

---

> With AI tutor I asked it many questions about questions I was being asked to complete assignments and it gave me ideas on how I could answer the question. I thought it was cool how it synced up to my canvas and could specifically ask questions about the courses I am taking. I think I can use Tutor AI to ask questions and help me brainstorm for my classes.

---

> At first I thought that having another AI but this one is just for Canvas felt redundant, since I can use one to ask questions that I may have about the assignment, but the moment I asked it about the upcoming assignments, not only did it show all the assignment and their due dates, it also gave a brief sentence on what to expect on it, which is super nice considering that it takes a lot of time reading, and then understanding. This AI does help a lot in the realm of focusing the tasks, and since it's tailored towards my assignments, I will find myself using to ask specific questions instead of asking the professor and waiting for a response, although, it's important to remember that if I have a question to always ask the professor first.

---

> I asked the AI Tutor about an assignment that's due on wednesday, and it brought up the assignment requirements, details, dates, and basically anything important. I like how you can select specific classes, as well as how it has access to the course so it can give you specific information about assignments, due dates, requirements, etc. I also like how it gives you links for the specific information it is giving you, that could help very much if you can't find a specific detail, date, or really anything.. It could be very useful. I will probably use it to summarize assignments and simplify my workload.

---

> The Artificial Intelligence Tutor tool helps me stay on top of my assignments. It can help me create a schedule that will allow me to stay on top of my assignments, without falling behind. Often as a student, it can be difficult to manage large workloads for multiple different classes. With the Artificial Intelligence Tutor, students can finally have aid in completing their assignments and creating ways to get ahead of them. As a Utah Valley University student, I will use the Artificial Intelligence Tutor to aid me with any questions regarding how to prepare best to complete my assignments and complete them before the assigned due date.

---

> I found this AI Tutor to not be the best. It helped me with very simple tasks such as "When is my next assignment due?", however when I asked another question that I thought was as simple as the one I just asked, "When do I have these classes?" half of the time it crashed on me showing me an error sign, the other 50% of the time it mixed up my classes, telling me that the classes I have on Monday and Wednesday, according to the AI, I have it on Tuesday and Thursday which is incorrect. I am incredibly hesitant about using this AI feature this semester as I encountered many bugs in most of my experiences with it. Once I see this application more ironed out, I may come to use it.

---

> I used AI Tutor to give me some background information about the play Antigone, by Sophocles. I asked about this because I have a discussion next week in my philosophy class so I wanted to get some brief background knowledge before I start reading the play. It helped go over the play and even added key themes and cultural context about the play. In all it helped me get a better understanding about what I am about to get into. I may use AI Tutor to help me with small things or to ask it questions to help guide me in the right direction of the topic.

---

> I asked the AI tutor to help me create a schedule to keep up with my History class and its readings. Not that I really need it but I just wanted to see what it could do. It did create a schedule but only for this week and for the two classes I asked it not to do, haha. That's all that I asked it to do because I didn't have a ton of time to explore it. I would use it to send me reminders or something for assignments a day before it is due. I do pretty good about remembering to turn stuff in but occasionally I forget smaller assignments.
