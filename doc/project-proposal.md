**To:** Susan Thackeray, Department Chair  
**From:** Ahmed Alsharif, AI Tutor Project Mentor  
**Date:** 9/3/2024  
**Subject:** Request for Additional Funding for AI Tutor Integration with Canvas

## Introduction
We are excited to report significant progress on the AI Tutor project, an initiative aimed at enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes, with potential for expansion across other courses. 

With the successful completion of the first stage funded by the GEL grant, we have developed and deployed the AI Tutor within the Tech1010 course. The next crucial step involves integrating the AI Tutor with the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) to enable seamless communication and interaction between the AI Tutor and the course materials hosted on Canvas.

We believe that this project aligns with the department’s commitment to innovation in education and student support.

## Project Overview
The AI Tutor project is designed to support students in their learning journey by providing real-time AI-powered assistance tailored to the course content. By integrating the AI Tutor with Canvas, we will enable the system to automatically access, analyze, and respond to student inquiries based on the course materials, fostering a more interactive and supportive learning environment.

### Current Status
- **AI Tutor Code Development**: The AI Tutor's basic functions are complete and operational.
- **GEL Grant Funding**: The initial $10,000 from the GEL grant has been successfully utilized to cover initial development costs.
- **Next Steps**: Integrating the AI Tutor with Canvas via API to enable direct interaction with course content.

## Request for Additional Funding
To ensure the success of this integration, we are requesting an additional $5,000 in funding from the department. These funds will be allocated as follows:

- **API Development and Integration**: $2,500  
  Development of secure API connections between the AI Tutor and Canvas.  
  Testing and troubleshooting to ensure smooth operation and data flow.
  
- **Cloud Services and Data Management**: $1,500  
  Scaling server capacity to handle increased data exchange between the AI Tutor and Canvas.  
  Implementation of data management protocols to ensure privacy and compliance with institutional policies.

- **Technical Support and Maintenance**: $1,000  
  Ongoing technical support during the integration phase.  
  Post-integration monitoring and adjustments to optimize performance.

## Justification
The integration of the AI Tutor with Canvas is a pivotal step that will significantly enhance its functionality and usability. This integration will allow for:

- **Automated Content Access**: The AI Tutor will be able to retrieve and interact with specific course materials directly from Canvas, ensuring that student queries are addressed with accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Enhanced Student Engagement**: By embedding the AI Tutor within the Canvas environment, students will have easier access to the tutor, increasing their likelihood of utilizing it as a resource.
- **Scalability**: Successful integration with Canvas will serve as a model for future expansions into other courses, maximizing the impact of the AI Tutor across the department.

## Development Team and Department Involvement
The development team behind the AI Tutor consists of experienced professionals, including two talented individuals from our department. 

The two students from the department managing the project are not only integral to the success of this project but also serve as exemplary models for our department’s students. Their involvement in this cutting-edge project offers a unique opportunity for department students to witness firsthand the application of their studies in real-world, high-impact technological development. This project demonstrates how the skills they acquire in their courses can translate into significant contributions to innovative educational tools.

We appreciate your consideration of this request and are happy to provide further details or discuss any questions you may have.

Thank you,  
Ahmed Alsharif
