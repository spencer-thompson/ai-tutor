== | What have you done since last team meeting?

- The academic paper that the Tech Management Department is writing for the AI Tutor finished its first draft.
  So, I read that paper to verify it, and provide analytics data for it.

- Part of the analytics that we checked is lifetime total users, which is *652*, which is quite cool.

- We are about to merge the tests written by Landon into the staging branch, and merge our current set of features and changes into main.

== | What obstacles are you encountering?

- The analytics containers that we are using seem to be broken.
  This is an important part of the project that needs to be fixed.

== | What do you plan to accomplish by the next team meeting?

- Finish pull requests and merges.

- Fixed analytics

- Added UX buttons to select which "role" of the tutor to use.

- Have automated tests running.
