== | What have you done since last team meeting?

- I fixed a lot of issues regarding the local development environment.
  We are using docker and docker compose for development and deployment,
  so I just cloned down the repository and fixed a lot of issues regarding the local environment.

- I successfully managed to migrate from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-5` which was a rather large refactor/addition.

== | What obstacles are you encountering?

- Getting the local development environment is still not working for Landon which is quite frustrating.

== | What do you plan to accomplish by the next team meeting?

- Getting the MongoDB database to initialize properly for development/staging and deployment.

- Getting the local environment working properly.
