== | What have you done since last team meeting?

- We started working on features, particularly moving to a new and improved API for OpenAI as well as nailing down a staging environment.

== | What obstacles are you encountering?

- Not really much, it has mostly been smooth sailing apart from our busy schedules.

== | What do you plan to accomplish by the next team meeting?

- Finish out the migration to the new API and have a solid development and staging environment.
